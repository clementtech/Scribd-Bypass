# Scribd-Bypass
Scribd-Bypass is a Python program designed to help users access Scribd document files for educational purposes in a user-friendly manner.

# Why I created this program.
I created this program during high school when I struggled to access documents required for my studies. Many study materials on Scribd are behind a paywall, making education inaccessible for many students around the world.

This program aims to bridge that gap and provide opportunities for less fortunate students to access study materials to support their education.

# How does it work?

### How normal Scribd document link looks like:
```
https://www.scribd.com/document/{document_id}/{document_title}
```

### What does the program do?
- It extracts the document ID from the provided link.
- It builds a unique URL to access the document.
- Copy the unique URL created and paste it into the user's clipboard.
- The program will then ask the user if they want the program to open the unique URL in their default web browser.

# Sneak Peek:
